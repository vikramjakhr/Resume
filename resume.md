## Objectives

Most of what you'll see in this resume was self taught, So learning new things is
an important objective in my life. I am a team player; an energetic
and smart team that I like to work with and learn from is also an
important objective.

## Education

### C-DAC Noida (India)
Master of Computer Applications (MCA)
2012-2015

## Skills

I have in the past used the following tools and technologies:

- **Go** (professional). I've been using Go since early 2015 and have
    created multiple applications, some of them are available on my github (see below).
- **Bash** (moderate). I'm by no means a good bash scripter but since
  the shell is the heart of all Unix systems, I'm forced to use it on
  a daily basis and get better at it everyday.
- **Linux**. I'm not a sysadmin, but since I use Linux
  personally and develop services that runs on Linux, I became
  familiar with modifying kernel parameters such as choosing different
  I/O schedulers as well as tools to debug and understand performance
  issues (e.g. iotop, dstat, etc.).
- **SQL** (moderate). I know just enough SQL to get my job done and
    look up the documentation when it gets complicated.
- **Other languages**. I've previously used Groovy/Grails,
    Java, Javascript for small and medium scale projects
    and for fun.

## Experience

### Professional experience

#### TO THE NEW

##### DevOps Engineer - August 2015 to till date

A digital technology services company that drives digital transformation 
and builds disruptive products by leveraging UX, 
cutting edge technologies, and cloud.

As part of being at TO THE NEW, I worked on the following:

- Setting up Infra on AWS
- Build CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins
- Infrastructure automation using Terraform
- Write and maintain a telegraf metric collection agent, that can monitor
  cpu, memory, load and processes.

### Open source experience

Contributing back to the open source community is an important
activity in my daily life because I believe in the OSS mission and to
show gratitude to my fellow developers who continuously build awesome
software that I use on a daily basis.

- **[Golang](https://codereview.appspot.com/9795043)**. Fixed a bug in
  the tls certificate checking code that prevented certificates with
  long chains to be used in golang.
- **[InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb)**. A
    lightweight distributed time series, events, and metrics database.
- **[Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri)**. Core
  maintainer of Nokogiri.
- **[JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby)**. Found and fixed
  multiple bugs related to String encoding in JRuby 1.7 when running
  in 1.9 mode and timezone handling.
- **[Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)**. Submitted a new test to
  enhance coverage of String encoding as a result of a bug found in
  JRuby.
- **[Minix](http://www.minix3.org/)**. As a college project I ported
  the Linux O(1) scheduler which was designed and implemented by Ingo
  Moln√°r to the Minix Operating System, though this work wasn't
  published or contributed back to the Minix code base.

### Undergraduate experience

#### Database applications testing research

AGENDA is a software testing research project that focused on testing and verifying
database applications and their interactions with the database.

- **SWING**. Reimplemented AGENDA as a SWING application as opposed to
  a web app to provide a better user experience while reusing most of
  the components used by the web based implementation.
- **Input data generation**. Improved the implementation of the fake
  data generation phase by using an in memory db to filter the data
  sets that violated any of the schema constraints.
- **Papers**. Shahid, Chays, Frankl. Query-based Test Generation for
  Database Applications.  Proceedings of the 1st intentional workshop
  on testing database systems, June 2008.
