## Objectives

Most of what you'll see in this resume was self taught, So learning new things is
an important objective in my life. I am a team player; an energetic
and smart team that I like to work with and learn from is also an
important objective.

## Education

### C-DAC Noida (India)
Master of Computer Applications (MCA)
2012-2015

## Skills 

- **AWS**. Well-versed in setting up and maintaining AWS Cloud Stack.
- **Azure**. Beginner in Azure but well enough to get up an running.
- **Jenkins/CI-CD**. Good knowledge of CI/CD pipeline for complete automation from commit to deployment.
- **Docker**. Proficient in container technology involving AWS ECS, Docker Swarm.
- **Kubernetes**. Strong knowledge and experience in Kubernetes. 
- **Linux**. I'm not a sysadmin, but since I use Linux
  personally and develop services that runs on Linux, I became
  familiar with modifying kernel parameters such as choosing different
  I/O schedulers as well as tools to debug and understand performance
  issues (e.g. iotop, dstat, etc.).
- **Terraform**. Proficient in creating Infrastructure as Code (IaaS) using terraform.  
- **Go**. I've been using Go since early 2016 and have
    created multiple applications, some of them are available on my github (see below).
- **Shell Scripting**. I'm by no means a good bash scripter but since
  the shell is the heart of all Unix systems, I'm forced to use it on
  a daily basis and get better at it everyday.
- **MySQL**. I know just enough SQL to get my job done and
    look up the documentation when it gets complicated.
- **Monitoring & Logging**. Has good hands using ELK, Cloudwatch, Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana, Kibana.
- **Ansible**. Enough to understand and start working on it.
- **NGinx**. Good knowledge of NGinx configuration, working, caching and optimizations.
